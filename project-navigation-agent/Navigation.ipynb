    "In this project I have implemented four different Agents with two different neural network architectures to solve the Banana Navigation OpenAI Gym problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The performances are as follows:\n",
    "- SingleAgent requires 557 episodes to solve the problem\n",
    "- DoubleAgent requires 634 episodes to solve the problem\n",
    "- TripleAgent requires 522 episodes to solve the problem\n",
    "- QuadrupleAgent requires 503 episodes to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I want to stress out, that the complexity of the algorithms of QuadrupleAgent are higher than of the SingleAgent. Therefore, solving in lesser episodes does not necessarily mean that the solution requires less computational time. Because training the QuadrupleAgent requires more time per episode than training the SingleAgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, it is clear that more advanced algorithms, with double q-learning, duelling neural networks, exponential linear units, dropout regularization or prioritized experience replay as shown in this project work are better than simple standard approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be seen in the RainBow https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298 implementation of DeepMind, which combines even more improvements for Deep Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "That would include to add parametric noise to the weights as described by https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, it would very well be worthwhile to try more of these improvements or a full RainBow approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further future work might include solving the problem from pixels. THen the agent, would not recieve a numerical input state vector, but an array of pixels, which need to be processed with convolutional layers. As described in the original DeepMind Nature paper https://deepmind.com/research/publications/human-level-control-through-deep-reinforcement-learning superhuman-control can be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, at last, a complete study of exploration of the hyperparameter space is necessary, which would lead to some questions like this: How many layers perform best? How many neurons? Which activation functions? Linear or exponential epsilon decay?  How to choose the discount factor for reward?\n",

    "More ideas:\n",
    "- Port the algorithm into C++...\n",
    "- Run the training on Nvidia Jetson..."
